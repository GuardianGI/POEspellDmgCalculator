fix off by about 1% dmg (probably rounding issue due to avg dmg instead of min/max for all calculations, probably messes with phys dmg as well)
calculate proper DPS for phys spells using min/max dmg.
area/difficulty support & monster selection: http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Monster_Experience
finish support gems
support gem applicability matrix
get APS for minions
apply APS to minion DPS
apply cast time & duration to max DPS for SRS
correctly apply correct increases: does desecrate benefit from spell damage, searing bond from burning dmg? etc.
half decent interface on "any" resolution (minimum of 1024px or maybe down to 800px width)
Aura support (anger & wrath for minions, haste for cast speed, etc.)
	?total mana reserved
mana per second usage
	?mana per second recovered (maybe not worth the effort w/o passive tree support)
	dps with mana regen, assuming empty mana pool.

curse cast speed
	avg. combat time (using monster life expectations & curse cast recomendations)

ambitious:
	implement passive tree
	passive tree recommendations
	passive tree multicast-like path calculations/suggestions/fullbuild
