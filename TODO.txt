todo:
	area/difficulty support & monster selection: http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Monster_Experience
	finish support gems
	support gem applicability matrix
	get APS for minions
	apply APS to minion DPS
	apply cast time & duration to max DPS for SRS
	correctly apply correct increases: does desecrate benefit from spell damage, searing bond from burning dmg? etc.
	half decent interface on "any" resolution (minimum of 1024px or maybe down to 800px width)
	Aura support (anger & wrath for minions, haste for cast speed, etc.)
		?total mana reserved
	mana per second usage
		?mana per second recovered (maybe not worth the effort w/o passive tree support)
		dps with mana regen, assuming empty mana pool.
	dps reliability/divergency (crit chance, min v.s. max dmg, cast speed)
		idea: divergence = (max dmg - min dmg) / casts per second
			crit: where cc (crit chance) is 0.05 for 5% and cd (crit multiplier) is 1 by default for 100% more dmg
				divergence /= cc

cool to have:
	curse cast speed
		avg. combat time (using monster life expectations & curse cast recomendations)
			reverse plot avg. combat time (quicker combat = higher on the scale)
	Import character gear from GGG API.
	Gear recommendations (what stats to look for on what gear pieces for max dps)
	
ambitious:
	implement passive tree
	passive tree recommendations
	passive tree multicast-like path calculations/suggestions/fullbuild
	passive tree full-build generator
	
	attack skills (will require gear/weapon for dps)
