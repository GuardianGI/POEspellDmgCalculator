todo:
	area/difficulty support & monster selection: http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Monster_Experience
	monster life = 2 * xp / lvl (seems about right on driping dead & brittle thiefs & Oozeback Bloom)
	finish support gems
	quality bonus for support gems
	support gem applicability matrix
	get APS for minions
	apply APS to minion DPS
	apply cast time & duration to max DPS for SRS
	correctly apply correct increases: does desecrate benefit from spell damage, searing bond from burning dmg? etc.
	half decent interface on "any" resolution (minimum of 1024px or maybe down to 800px width) (now looks fine on 1280 width and handles other resulotuions decently.)
	Aura support (anger & wrath for minions, haste for cast speed, etc.)
		?total mana reserved
	mana per second usage
		?mana per second recovered (maybe not worth the effort w/o passive tree support)
		dps with mana regen, assuming empty mana pool.
	dps reliability/divergency (crit chance, min v.s. max dmg, cast speed)
		idea: divergence = (max dmg - min dmg) / casts per second
			crit: where cc (crit chance) is 0.05 for 5% and cd (crit multiplier) is 1 by default for 100% more dmg
				divergence /= cc

bugs:
	apply spell echo, then spell totem: spell echo still allowed. spell totem takes presedence and spell echo should get removed.

cool to have:
	curse cast speed
		avg. combat time (using monster life expectations & curse cast recomendations)
			reverse plot avg. combat time (quicker combat/faster kill rate = higher on the scale)
				calc as: top(life / dps / casts per second) * casts per second
				ex. monster life = 100, dps = 99, casts per second = 0.5, combat time: 100 / 99 = 1.01 sec => 3 casts: top(1.01 / 0.5) = 3 => 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 sec combat time
	Import character gear from GGG API.
	Gear recommendations (what stats to look for on what gear pieces for max dps)
	attack support gems (for minions and maybe later attack skills)
	
ambitious:
	implement passive tree
	passive tree recommendations
	passive tree multicast-like path calculations/suggestions/fullbuild
	passive tree full-build generator
	
	attack skills (will require gear/weapon for dps)
